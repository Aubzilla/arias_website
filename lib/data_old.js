				layer:  		"<div id='about_info'><h2>about <span id='accent'>arias</span>architecture</h2><p>arias architecture is a New York based architectural design office specializing in commercial, residential, and urban design. This office has designed and successfully completed buildings in several countries including Argentina, Mexico, Japan, and the USA. </p><p>The major design principles of our architectural and urban design work can be summarized in the following statements: </br></br>-Our work is based on concrete design concepts, not on architectural styles. These design concepts are architectural interpretations of our clients\' goals and desires, which constitute an essential factor in the uniqueness of every project.</br></br>-Our work aims for an ecologically conscientious and sustainable built environment. Buildings use around 40 percent of the energy consumed in our planet ... it is our mission as an office to foster architectural decisions contributing to preserve the earth resources for future generations. </p><p>The buildings of our era need to be sustainable, and there is a growing conscience about the issue, but they also still need to be exciting and thought provoking.., boring architecture built with recyclable materials is not enough. </br></br>-Our work considers the integration of architecture and technology as a critical aspect in the design process. The spaces of our era are not only configured by walls, floors and roofs, but also by sounds, digital images, controlled lighting, air conditioning.., these new elements and their systems play a major role in the space configuration and character of contemporary spaces, and need to be aesthetically and functionally integrated in the architectural space as a whole.</br></br>-Our work strives for excellence in architectural design at all scales, regardless of the project\'s size. There is the same room for creativity when designing a chair, a house, a skyscraper, or a city.</br></br>-Our work creates architectural spaces based on organic geometrical orders found in nature such as the fractals, and on mathematical formulas derived from nature. The utilization of these geometries seems also very natural and adequate to create sustainable architecture, it guarantees a harmonic relation between the parts and the whole in a building, and it contributes to generate highly distinctive and attractive architectural and urban spaces. </p></div>"
